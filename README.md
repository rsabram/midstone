### Motivation

From 2014-2016, I taught high school math and computer science in rural South Carolina. I taught primarily juniors and seniors, and as a wide-eyed Teach for America corps member I was determined to ensure 100% of my students could apply, attend, and graduate from college. I quickly realized this was not reality for my students - about 30% of the graduating class attended college after graduation and 30% of that population would go on to complete their degree. One particular barrier to higher education that concerned me was access to a testing location for the ACT or SAT. These tests are required for admittance to colleges and universities, and often a prerequisite for scholarships. 

I remember my own college application experience - I took the SAT and the ACT each 2-3 times at the high school I attended, which was a 5 minute drive from my house. My mom woke me up, made me a “breakfast is the most important meal of the day” breakfast, and double checked my purse to make sure I had my ID and my graphing calculator.My second year teaching, I had 12 of  my students - 12 seniors planning to take the October administration of the ACT. For seniors, the October ACT is your last chance to get a score you can submit to most universities for admittance or scholarship. For these twelve students, I had reminded them to register and then helped them register and I had harassed the guidance counselor for their fee waivers. I reminded them to study and we did practice questions in class. The Friday before the test, I printed their test admission tickets, I passed out calculators, and I made sure they had plenty of sharpened pencils. I had a group chat all ready to go for 7 am to make sure they were awake and on their way to their 8am test.

Two of them overslept. Another two were supposed to carpool, but the brother who was supposed to pick them up never showed. 8/12 showed up and took the test. 66% (as a teacher, that’s an F) when I felt like I did everything I could except physically wake them up and drive them there.

We underestimate the role that privilege plays. My kids don’t have their own car to drive themselves. Their parents work on Saturdays so they can’t drive them, and they leave too early to wake them up. There’s no Uber (and no credit card to pay for the uber) or public transportation and it’s not within walking distance. The closest place they could take the ACT was 45 minutes away. It is and it was stupid things like that that gets in the way for my kids. They want to succeed, to go to college, to take the ACT, to do well, but it’s the simple things like having an ACT test center down the road that we are too privileged to recognize as advantages that are the obstacles for my kids. I researched SAT and ACT testing locations because I saw that access to testing sites was an obstacle for my students to access higher education.


### Data Questions

1. Is there a difference in **demographic groups** for high schools that are:
- **Rural vs. Urban**
- **Testing Sites vs. Non Testing Sites**

2. Is there a statistically significant difference in **demographic groups, school quality, or SAT scores** for high schools that are testing sites vs. those that are not?
